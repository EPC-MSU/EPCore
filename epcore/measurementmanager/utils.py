    Experimental search for optimal settings for specified IVMeasurer.
    During the search IVMeasurer should be connected to a testing component.
    IVCurve with the optimal settings will have the most meaningful form.
    For example for a capacitor it should be ellipse.
    Warning! During the search a set of measurements with various settings will be performed.
    To avoid damage donâ€™t use this function for sensitive components.
